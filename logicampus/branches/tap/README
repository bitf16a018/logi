INSTALLATION
================================================================================
Read docs/INSTALL for more information on installation.


WEB SERVER WRITE ACCESS TO DIRECTORIES
================================================================================
permissions.sh will set insecure permissions with chmod
for the installer to work properly.  You should, ideally,
have root on the target machine and chown those directories 
to your webserver user.


BUILD FROM CVS
================================================================================
You might need ant to build from a CVS checkout.  The build.xml is an ant 
script. Visit the ant website for more information.

DUMMY DATA FOR DEMO CD
================================================================================
The script wipe_clean.sh in the data/ dir will erase all
tables in your chosen database and insert starting data.

Run "sh ./wipe_clean.sh user pass (db)" to install or 
re-install the database for demo purposes.

This file is required for the demo CD to run properly.
