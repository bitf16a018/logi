 *       ABOUT LOGICAMPUS         *
 **********************************

LogiCampus is an open source educational learning system developed by Tap 
Internet, Inc. in conjunction with Tarant County College Center for Distance 
Learning.  LogiCampus provides various tools for educators to manage online 
courses or classroom courses.  Please visit http://logicampus.sf.net/ for 
more information about the specific features of LogiCampus. LogiCampus is 
built on top of the php-based application server called LogiCreate 
(http://www.logicreate.com) .

 **********************************
 *       SERVER REQUIREMENTS      *
 **********************************

The following requirements are needed to run LogiCampus:
	* Apache web server  1.3 or higher (see http://www.logicreate.com 
	  if you are using Apache 2.0)
	* PHP 4.3.1 or higher (PHP 5 tested but not required)
	* MySQL Database 3.23 or higher, 4.0 preferred
	* Server - Linux is recommended to use setup scripts
	* PHP must be compiled with the following extensions - gd 2.0  
	* Tidy (tidy.sourceforge.net) - optional, but helps with importing of content

 ********************************************
 *  LOGICAMPUS WEB-BASED INSTALL PROCEDURE  *
 ********************************************

Copy the .tar.gz file you downloaded to the directory above the web server's 
"document root" directory. For example, if your document root of your web 
server is /var/www/html, copy the .tar.gz file to /var/www.  NOTICE we are 
one directory above the document root folder. 

Next, run the commands:

tar -xvfz logicampus-XX.tar.gz  (where XX is your version number)

The contents of the file are two directories - logicreate/ and public_html/ 
and other help files. 

The contents of the 'public_html' folder will need to be copied to the 
installation's document root.  You can do this by modifying your document 
root to point to 'public_html' or copy all of the files in 'public_html' 
to your document root.  Here is an example of a directory layout for a 
server install:
/
	var/
		www/
			logicreate/
			public_html/
			logicreate.tar.gz

For install purposes only so the web-based installer can write to the
file system set the following on the public_html directory:

chmod 777 public_html

DO NOT LEAVE THE PERMISSIONS THIS WAY
THIS IS JUST FOR THE INSTALL

Next, change the permissions on public_html/defines.php so the web
server can write to this file.  

chmod 777 public_html/defines.php

Next, run the web-based installer.  Example: 

http://yourdomain.com/public_html/index.php

or

http://yourdomain.com/index.php


DO NOT RUN THE FILE NAMED "install.php"


Adjust the above url based on your document root of your web server
and where you installed LogiCampus.  After the install runs you will
be given further instructions on how to setup your server permissions. 

 *************************************
 *       RUN PERMISSIONS SCRIPT 	 *
 *************************************


Adjust file permissions (Linux and Mac OS X only)

The permissions.sh script will set insecure permissions with chmod
for the installer to work properly.  You should, ideally, have root on 
the target machine and chown those directories to your webserver user.

logicreate/scripts/setpermission.sh


Allowing multiple users to run PHP scripts on any server is inherently 
insecure.  Adjusting the LogiCampus file permissions is just one step in 
keeping a secure server.  Here are recommended permissions for files.

LogiCreateBase/						770 user.webserver
		logicreate/				770 user.webserver
				services/ 		660 user.webserver
				lib/			660 user.webserver
				content/		770 user.webserver (set -R)
				lcFiles/		770 user.webserver
		public_html/				660 user.webserver
				index.php
				templates/		550 user.webserver
				images/			470 user.webserver
					photos/		470 user.webserver
						thumbs/ 	470 user.webserver

				herc/			440 user.webserver

Note: Adjusting the file permissions like so may not allow you to delete 
modules from the HCC.

 *************************************
 *     SETUP MASTER CONTROL PANEL    *
 *************************************

Setting up the Control Center

The Hercules Control Center is the 'master' control panel for LogiCampus.  
While most of the features are assessible in the administration
interface, there are a few things that you will need to access,
especiallhy if you are developing other applictions for LogiCampus.

The Hercules Control Center requires you to define a username and password.  By 
default it will not allow any access until the file public_html/herc/auth.php has been edited properly.  Open public_html/herc/auth.php in a text editor and you will see these lines:

define(HERC_USER,'');
define(HERC_PASSWD,'');
//set to 1 to use md5 passwords
define(PASSWD_IS_MD5,0);

If you wanted Herc and HHH as your Control Center login you would edit the file 
like so:

define(HERC_USER,'Herc');
define(HERC_PASSWD,'HHH');
//set to 1 to use md5 passwords
define(PASSWD_IS_MD5,0);

Being that this file must be readable by the webserver, any other system user 
that can program the webserver (via php, perl, or similar scripts) can open 
the document and read it.  To bypass plain text passwords the option 
PASSWD_IS_MD5 has been added.  To hash your chosen password, type this command 
at a Unix command line:

echo -n 'HHH' | md5sum

The output should paste nicely into the auth.php file.  An md5 sum cannot be 
used as a valid login, it is only a means of protecting the original password.  
Here is a sample auth.php with has the user Herc and the password HHH but uses 
md5 hash protection:

define(HERC_USER,'Herc');
define(HERC_PASSWD,'62f3c4ba6cfdc13a43b6fd2a68b39f5e');
//set to 1 to use md5 passwords
define(PASSWD_IS_MD5,1);
