The shell script `wipe_clean.sh' will remove every table and 
install dummy data used for testing.  Only use this on demo 
or test systems.  You should remove this directory from production 
systems to avoid potential problems.

The shell script `install_metainfo.sh' will drop all tables and 
re-create them completely blank.
