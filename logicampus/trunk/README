BUILD FROM CVS
================================================================================
You will need "ant" to create a LogiCampus build from a CVS checkout.  
The build.xml is an ant script. Visit the ant website for more information.
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

Make sure "build/applylicense.sh" is executable.  

Example:  chmod 755 ./build/applylicense.sh

Once ant is installed and in your path, from the top level CVS
directory type:

ant

A logicampus-OSS.tar.gz file will be built and placed in ./dist/.
Once you have this file, just follow docs/INSTALL.


INSTALLATION
================================================================================
Read docs/INSTALL for more information on installation.


WEB SERVER WRITE ACCESS TO DIRECTORIES
================================================================================
permissions.sh will set insecure permissions with chmod
for the installer to work properly.  You should, ideally,
have root on the target machine and chown those directories 
to your webserver user.

SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================
Read the SAMPLE_DATA file for sample passwords.

DUMMY DATA FOR DEMO CD
================================================================================
The script wipe_clean.sh in the data/ dir will erase all
tables in your chosen database and insert starting data.

Run "sh ./wipe_clean.sh user pass (db)" to install or 
re-install the database for demo purposes.

This file is required for the demo CD to run properly.
