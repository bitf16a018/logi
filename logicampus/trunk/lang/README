Translation files go here.  Two methods of internationalization are planned to 
be supported: GNU Gettext and a custom LogiCreate system.  Original and 
translated works will go into a custom XML format developed for LogiCreate and
other PHP projects.  These XML files can then be compiled into a custom PHP 
solution or converted into GNU Gettext's .po file format, and then from there 
into .mo files.  The potential also exists to compile the XML directly to .mo 
file format, but duplicating GNU Gettext's msgformat command is not high 
priority.


To complete a translation:
===============================================================================
Copy the messages.en_US.xml to a new file, replace the 'en_US' with your
chosen language and country abbreviation.  Translate only the text inside the 
<message> tags of the XML.  Make sure to change the charset and locale 
attributes of the language tag at the top.  After that you can compile the 
translated file into a LogiCreate translation file with the following line:

php ./buildtrans.php [en_US] > ../src/logicreate/lang/lct.php

That will place the resulting translation file it the proper place.
