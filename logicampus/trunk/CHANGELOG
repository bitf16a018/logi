data/sql - 
The ability to give certain groups permission to be able to update
enrollments.  Note:  If someone is given access to the enrollment,
they have to have access to users.

01/09/03 12:11 PM - zorka
adminstration - 
This adds the ability for an admin to manage student enrollment.  The
main account interface was modified to display all semesters and
classes and a user is enrolled in.  This should help helpdesk staff to
know which classes a user is or is not enrolled in.  When you select
the 'manage class enrollment' it shows the classes a student is
enrolled in for the current semester.  There is a drop down to select
another semester to view.

Other features include the ability to remove a student from a class,
suspend and active a student for a given class.
